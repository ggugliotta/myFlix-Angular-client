- Flickette is a movie application built for movie fans who enjoy learning information about a variety of films. Users are able to access this application whenever they want to read and save information about their favorite movies. This app is [hosted online]() and can be viewed on any device at any time anywhere for complete user experience. This [client-side project](github.com/ggugliotta/myFlix-Angular-client) supports the [server-side portion of this application](github.com/ggugliotta/movie-app) and was created to facilitate user requests and render responses from the server-side via multiple interface views. This app was built in ES2015+ with the full MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), and Angular Material UI library. A full list of project dependencies are outlined below. 

- My movie app utilizes [render](render.com) to connect with my [API](www.mongodb.com) and [ghpages](ghpages.com)for the front-end server. View here:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
